## Hi there 👋
# 👋 About Me  

I have always dreamed of working in game development and creating my own game, but something kept holding me back. After earning a bachelor's degree in international trade, I spent a few years in the field before venturing into the agro-industrial business. However, after facing setbacks, I decided it was time to pursue what I truly love—game development.  

I had a strong foundation in math, completing the school curriculum early in 8th grade and studying at a Kazakh-Turkish high school. I also learned the basics of C++ and was part of a math olympiad team alongside an IMO silver medalist.  

In February 2025, I took the leap and started learning Unity and C#. I’m currently working through the **Junior Programmer: Create with Code** course on Unity Learn, studying C# on Microsoft Learn, and following various IT courses. I’m also developing a **3D clicker game in Unity**, exploring game mechanics, and working on small projects to sharpen my skills.  

🎯 **Goals:**  
- Become a skilled game developer  
- Release my own projects  
- Learn multiplayer game development in Unity
- Gain experience for developing an **RPG with a unique leveling mechanic**  
- Work on a **strategy game with parallel worlds**  

💻 **Current Projects:**  
- 🕹 3D Clicker Game (Unity)
- ⚔ **Fantasy RPG (2D/3D)** – A long-term project with a unique leveling system (gaining experience for development)  
- 🌍 **Strategy Game with Parallel Worlds** – A concept in early design stages    
- 🔧 Small C# & Unity experiments

### 🎉 **Fun Fact:**  
I started the **Unity Junior Programmer: Create with Code** course on **February 3rd** and completed it on **February 19th**. But here's the crazy part: on **February 4th**, I broke my shoulder and had surgery, getting a metal plate implanted. I was discharged from the hospital on **February 8th**, and despite my right arm being almost useless, I kept learning IT! I did most of the coding with my **left hand** (even though I'm right-handed), while my right hand could only reach **half of the touchpad** and barely move beyond **J, K, L** on the keyboard. 😅
